## Introduction

Inter-coder reliability serves as a cornerstone of rigorous empirical research, particularly in the social sciences. The K-Alpha Calculator, *Krippendorff's Alpha Calculator*,  is designed to simplify the computation of Krippendorff’s Alpha, one of the most widely employed statistical measures for inter-coder reliability (Krippendorff, 2019).
By providing a free tool with a user-friendly interface for calculating this coefficient, the K-Alpha Calculator aims to enhance research quality and reliability by offering an accessible and standalone tool for user.
For an in-depth review of the theoretical and mathematical underpinnings of Krippendorff's Alpha, please refer to [Krippendorff (2019)](https://doi.org/10.4135/9781071878781). For a detailed overview of The K-Alpha Calculator please refer to our [academic article](https://www.k-alpha.org/article).

## Software Description

The K-Alpha Calculator is hosted at [k-alpha.org](https://www.k-alpha.org/), it is completely free, and its open-source code can be accessed here on [GitHub](https://github.com/davide-marchiori/k-alpha). The code behind the K-Alpha Calculator performs the calculation steps following the procedure on [Krippendorff (2019)](https://doi.org/10.4135/9781071878781). It also incorporates the adjustments and considerations outlined in the bootstrapping method as described by [Hayes and Krippendorff (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1080/19312450709336664).

### How to Use

The use of K-Alpha Calculator follows a **three-step approach**:

1. **Data Upload**: Users upload a data file in `.csv` format that adheres to specific formatting requirements. 
 -   *File Type*: The file must be a .csv (Comma-Separated Values) format. **The separator must be a comma (,) or a semicolon (;). Tab or other separators are not allowed.**
-   *Layout*: Data should be organized in a matrix format where:
    
    -   Rows represent individual items to be coded.
        
    -   Columns correspond to the coders providing these codes.
        
    -   **Code values must be represented numerically. Decimals are not allowed**
        
    -   `NA` represents a missing value.
        
-   *Content*: Each cell within this matrix should contain the code assigned by a coder to a specific item. Data should be [nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement)
   
2. **Data Type Specification**: After the data file is uploaded, the user specify the nature of the data (Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, Ratio).

3. **Result Interpretation**: K-Alpha Calculator processes the uploaded data and outputs the Krippendorff's Alpha value, which reflects the level of agreement among coders. Confidence Intervals (CI) are also available with bootstrap.
An acceptable level of reliability should be equal or above `0.80`, as suggested by [Krippendorff (2019)](https://doi.org/10.4135/9781071878781).

### Data Privacy

The K-Alpha Calculator does not store any data and deletes all data upon the completion of the calculation instance.

## Illustrative Examples

### Data Structure

Consider a scenario with 5 items, 3 coders, and 2 categories represented by the values ‘1’  and ‘2’ (nominal data).​ The data file should comprise 5 rows (one for each item) and 3 columns (one for each coder). The cell values denote the codes assigned. An example representation is as follows:


    1,1,1
    1,1,1
    1,2,1
    1,1,1
    2,2,2

### Missing Values

When a coder has not assigned a code to an item, the corresponding cell should be marked as ‘NA’ (without quotation marks). For example, if coder 3 did not assign a code to item 1 and coder 2 did not assign a code to item 4, the data file should appear as follows:

    1,1,NA
    1,1,1
    1,2,1
    1,NA,1
    2,2,2
