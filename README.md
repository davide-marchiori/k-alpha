## Introduction

Inter-coder reliability serves as a cornerstone of rigorous empirical research, particularly in the social sciences. The K-Alpha Calculator, *Krippendorff's Alpha Calculator*, is conceived to address the computational challenges often associated with one of the most widely employed statistical measures for inter-coder reliability: Krippendorff's Alpha. 
By offering a user-friendly interface to calculate this coefficient, the K-Alpha Calculator aims to contribute to the enhancement of research quality and reliability. 
For an in-depth review of the theoretical underpinnings of Krippendorff's Alpha and its importance, please refer to our [academic article](https://www.k-alpha.org/article).

## Software Description

The K-Alpha Calculator is hosted at [k-alpha.org](https://www.k-alpha.org/), it free, and its open-source code can be accessed on [GitHub](https://github.com/davide-marchiori/k-alpha).

### How to Use

The application follows a **three-step approach**:

1. **Data Upload**: Users must upload a data file in `.csv` format that adheres to specific formatting requirements. 
 -   *File Type*: The file must be a .csv (Comma-Separated Values) format. The separator must be a comma (,) not a semicolon (;) or tab.
-   *Layout*: Data should be organized in a matrix format where:
    
    -   Rows represent individual items to be coded.
        
    -   Columns correspond to the coders providing these codes.
        
    -   **Code values must be represented numerically.**
        
    -   NA represents a missing value.
        
-   *Content*: Each cell within this matrix should contain the code assigned by a coder to a specific item. Data should be [nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement)
   
2. **Data Type Specification**: After the data file is uploaded, the user must specify the nature of the data from the following options:
   - Nominal
   - Ordinal
   - Interval
   - Ratio

3. **Result Interpretation**: The calculator processes the uploaded data and outputs the Krippendorff's Alpha value, which reflects the level of agreement among coders. Confidence Intervals (CI) are also available. 
An acceptable level of reliability should be equal or above 0.80, as suggested by Krippendorff (2004).

### Data Privacy

The K-Alpha Calculator does not store any data and deletes all data upon the completion of the calculation instance.

## Illustrative Examples

### File Format

Consider a scenario with 5 items and 3 coders. The data file should comprise 5 rows (one for each item) and 3 columns (one for each coder). The cell values denote the codes assigned. An example representation is as follows:

    1,1,1
    1,1,1
    1,2,1
    1,1,1
    2,2,2

### Handling Missing Values

In instances where a coder has not assigned a code to an item, the corresponding cell should be marked as "NA". For example, if coder 3 did not assign a code to item 1 and coder 2 did not assign a code to item 4, the data file should appear as follows:

    1,1,NA
    1,1,1
    1,2,1
    1,NA,1
    2,2,2
