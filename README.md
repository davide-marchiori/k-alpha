## Motivation and Significance

Inter-coder reliability serves as a cornerstone of rigorous empirical research, particularly in the social sciences. The K-Alpha Calculator is conceived to address the computational challenges often associated with one of the most widely employed statistical measures for inter-coder reliability: Krippendorff's Alpha. By offering a user-friendly interface to calculate this coefficient, the K-Alpha Calculator aims to contribute to the enhancement of research quality and reliability in the social sciences. For an in-depth review of the theoretical underpinnings of Krippendorff's Alpha and its importance, please refer to our [comprehensive article](https://www.k-alpha.org/article).

## Software Description

The K-Alpha Calculator is hosted at [k-alpha.org](https://www.k-alpha.org/), and its open-source code can be accessed on [GitHub](https://github.com/davide-marchiori/k-alpha).

### How to Use

The application follows a **three-step approach**:

1. **Data Upload**: Users must upload a data file in `.csv` format that adheres to specific formatting requirements. 
   - Rows should represent the items to be coded.
   - Columns should represent the coders.
   - File should not contain headers, footers, or labels.
   - File size must not exceed 1MB.
   
2. **Data Type Specification**: After the data file is uploaded, the user must specify the nature of the data from the following options:
   - Nominal
   - Ordinal
   - Interval
   - Ratio

3. **Result Interpretation**: The calculator processes the uploaded data and outputs the Krippendorff's Alpha value, which reflects the level of agreement among coders.

### Data Privacy

The K-Alpha Calculator does not store any data and deletes all data upon the completion of the calculation instance.

## Illustrative Examples

### File Format

The data file should be a `.csv` file formatted as follows:

\```
1,2,1
1,1,1
1,2,1
1,2,2
1,3,2
\```

### Handling Missing Values

If a coder did not assign a code to an item, the corresponding cell should be left empty. For instance:

\```
,2,1
1,1,1
1,2,1
1,2,2
1,3,2
\```
