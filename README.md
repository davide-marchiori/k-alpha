## Introduction

Inter-rater reliability is a cornerstone of rigorous empirical research in different contexts and domains. The K-Alpha Calculator, *Krippendorff's Alpha Calculator*,  is designed to simplify the computation of Krippendorff’s Alpha, one of the most widely employed statistical measures for inter-rater reliability (Krippendorff, 2019).
By providing a free tool with a user-friendly interface for calculating this coefficient, the K-Alpha Calculator aims to enhance research quality and reliability by offering an accessible and standalone tool for users.
For an in-depth review of the theoretical and mathematical underpinnings of Krippendorff's Alpha, please refer to [Krippendorff (2019)](https://doi.org/10.4135/9781071878781). For a detailed overview of The K-Alpha Calculator please refer to our academic article, [Marzi et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2023.102545).

## Software Description

The K-Alpha Calculator is hosted at [k-alpha.org](https://www.k-alpha.org/). It is completely free, and its source code can be accessed here on [GitHub](https://github.com/davide-marchiori/k-alpha). The code behind the K-Alpha Calculator performs the calculation steps following the procedure on [Krippendorff (2019)](https://doi.org/10.4135/9781071878781), discussed in  [Marzi et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2023.102545).

### How to Use

The use of K-Alpha Calculator follows a **three-step approach**:

1. **Data Upload**: Users upload a data file in `.csv` format that meets specific formatting requirements. 
 -   *File Type*: The file must be in a .csv (Comma-Separated Values) format. **The separator must be a comma (,) or a semicolon (;). Tab or other separators are not allowed.** File size limit: 500KB.
-   *Layout*: Data should be organized in a matrix format where:
    
    -   Rows represent individual items to be rated.
        
    -   Columns correspond to the raters providing these rates.
        
    -   **Rate values must be represented numerically. Decimals are not allowed.**
        
    -   `NA` represents a missing value. **Empty cells are not allowed.**
        
-   *Content*: Each cell within this matrix should contain the rate a rater assigns to a specific item. Data should be [nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement)
   
2. **Data Type Specification**: After the data file is uploaded, the user specifies the nature of the data (Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, Ratio).

3. **Result Interpretation**: K-Alpha Calculator processes the uploaded data and outputs Krippendorff's Alpha value, reflecting the agreement level among raters. Confidence Intervals (CI) are also available with bootstrap.
An acceptable level of reliability should be equal to or above `0.80`, as suggested by [Krippendorff (2019)](https://doi.org/10.4135/9781071878781).

### Data Privacy

As the authors and maintainers of the K-Alpha Calculator, we are committed to preserving high standards of ethical conduct in data management and user privacy. We assure users that all data input into the K-Alpha Calculator remains exclusively within the user's domain, as the calculator operates entirely on the client side. This means it functions solely within the user's browser environment, guaranteeing that no data is retained, stored, or transmitted to external servers or storage systems.

## Illustrative Examples

### Data Structure

Consider a scenario with 5 items, 4 raters, and 3 categories represented by the values ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’ (nominal data).​ The data file should comprise 5 rows (one for each item) and 4 columns (one for each rater). The cell values denote the rates assigned. An example representation is as follows:

    1,1,1,1
    2,2,3,2
    3,3,3,3
    3,3,3,3
    2,2,2,2

### Missing Values

When a rater has not assigned a rate to an item, the corresponding cell should be marked as ‘NA’ (without quotation marks). For example, if rater 3 did not assign a rate to item 1 and rater 2 did not assign a rate to item 4, the data file should appear as follows:

    1,1,NA,1
    2,2,3,2
    3,3,3,3
    3,NA,3,3
    2,2,2,2
